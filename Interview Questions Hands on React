Build these to get comfortable with UI basics and React syntax.

Basic Todo App
Counter with increment/decrement
Form component with state handling
Modal (open/close logic)
Debounced Search Bar
React Router (basic routing)
Single Pagination
Login Form with validations
Dropdown Menu component
Theme toggle (Light/Dark)

Focus on clean structure, reusability, and basic hooks.

Go Deep (Medium Level)

Here, the goal is composition + state management + real API usage.

Weather App (API calls)
Basic Chat UI
CRUD App with Firebase
Multi-step Form Wizard
Responsive Sidebar
Data Table with Sort/Pagination
Custom Hook for Form Validation
CSS Grid Layout (mobile-first)
Image Carousel
Drag and Drop UI
Search Filter on List
Movie Search App (OMDB or TMDB API)
Infinite Scroll Component
Global State with Context API
File Upload UI
Mini Cart System
Sticky Header on Scroll
Real-time Chat with WebSockets
Dashboard with Charts (Chart.js / Recharts)
Autocomplete Input
This is where real UI logic questions usually lie. Think logic, not just layout.

Time to think like a systems designer. These projects will challenge your architecture decisions.
